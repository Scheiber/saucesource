## Add some fuel to your fire.

Need to spice up your life? SauceSource is a React-based web app that allows a user to learn about and curate different types of hot sauces. Users can navigate see a selection of different sauces, complete with images of their bottles, as well as information about their rating on Scoville Scale, what foods they go best with, and if the sauce is organic or kosher.

## Notable Features

- Designed to be fully responsive. Works great on both desktop and mobile.
- Asks to confirm deletion of any sauce, just to check that you're really sure.
